# data-unit-test open source governance

The data-unit-test project's chief and primary concern is with the development of tests for database in general and big data in particular as an open source library. The data-unit-test project's governance model thus reflects only the need to steer the engineering in the above direction and not any other activities which are out of scope.

Our governance model is as follows:

* There is a single Tech Architect, who will have the final say on all decisions regarding technical direction.
* There is a single Product Owner, who will have the final say on all decisions regarding new features to be incorporated.
* The Tech Architect directs the Core Committers, whose members include the Tech Architect and those who have been appointed by the Tech Architect as Core Committers.
* In the event the Tech Architect is unable to perform his or her duties, or abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst themselves.
* In the event there are no Core Committers, Autodesk Inc. will appoint one.

## Core Committers:

* Tech Architect: Yann Landrin-Schweitzer
* Product Owner: Sarang Anajwala
* Developer: Ashwini Kumar
